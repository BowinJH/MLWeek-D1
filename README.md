# Machine Learning Week Day 1

Last few slides still under WIP

## NTU, MLDA @ EEE
**National Technological University,**

**Machine Learning Data Analytics @ School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering**

Machine Learning Week Day 1 Part 1 Presentation

**Duration: 1.5h**

## Topics

### Intro to Python
I use mathematical concepts to introduce students to Python. This comes with the assumption that they have no clue about Python.

I go through the essentials if they want to start out on Machine Learning.

#### Math to Python Focuses
- Multivariable Function conversion (i.e. f(x, y) = z)
- Nested Functions (i.e. f(f(x))
- Prepared Functions (i.e. math.log(x))

### Intro to Python Data Preparation
This focuses heavily on preparing students on how to Google the right concepts and what are the common terms in Data Preparation.

Despite me focusing on functions, I try to deliver the idea that everyone can do data science if they google the right things.

#### Function Focuses
- Selecting
- Splitting
- Aggregating
- Unique
- Joining
